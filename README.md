# We Only Get One Planet

> 48 hour Hackathon project aimed to combine different data sources into an application
>
> This application is designed to create a platform for users to find out more about the detrimental effects of plastic pollution and connect to public events calling for volunteers help cleanup local communities

### Requirements
> - Combine at least 4 **external** resources via AJAX requests and present the returned information in an application
> - Must be documented loosely on JSDOC standards
> - All API interactions must be encapsulated in an OOP object defined with a class
>   - must use class
>   - must have methods to access the data
>   - must pass data to subsequent functions with callbacks upon getting data
> - Must be issue-managed via meistertask or trello

### Judging Criteria
> - **Appeal**: is it visually appealing / well put together
> - **Code Quality**: is the code properly formatted, are variables and functions well defined and documented
> - **Presentation**: How well is it presented during the unveiling session
> - **Task / Issue Management**: How well was the development process documented / controlled.  Were there well-defined issues, milestones, and project management
> - **Innovative / Transformative**: Did the project do something new and exciting?  Was it bold and tried to do things that haven't been done much.  Did it combine the data sources together in a way that was more useful than either source by itself
> - **Ease of Use / Understanding**: Was it easy to use the application / game, or if it was more complex, was the application or game able to provide you with tutorials or instructions that made understanding it a breeze.
