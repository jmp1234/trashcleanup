                            <p>This application was developed during a 48 hour hackathon.</p>
                            <p>Right away we knew that we wanted to do something community oriented. We chose to focus on our local beaches, since their popularity means that they are often littered with trash.</p>
                            <p>We designed this app to make it easier for people to connect with other volunteers to help keep our beaches clean - every little bit helps, and we hope to inspire people to take charge and be proud of their community.</p>

                            <p>To make it easier for people to see what beach clean up events were happening near them, we chose to make our map the focus of our screen.</p>
